The codebase is aslo used for our participation in the VarDial 2025 Shared Task on Norwegian Slot and Intent Detection, named [LTG at VarDial 2025 NorSID: More and Better Training Data for Slot and Intent Detection](https://aclanthology.org/2025.vardial-1.15/) (Midtgaard et al., 2025). Some scripts, settings and datasets have been further improved and extended as part of the master's thesis work, compared to the original shared task submission.
